# Car_tail_Lamp_Control using VHDL

Creat Design, Simulation and Implementation of a sequentially illuminated 6-tail light system.


## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

* Create new project on Vivado with Basys3 Board selected.
* Create files for each design, simulation, Constraint.
* Original code has commented out clock for simulation. If you would like to do simulation,<\n>
make sure uncomment clock and comment out slow clock.

### Dependencies

* Vivado 2020.2
* Windows 10
 

## Help

* If your simulation works but not working on board, make sure you have slow clock in design source.
